# Avatar Animator

Avatar Animator is a fork of [Pose Animator](https://github.com/yemount/pose-animator), a fast and real-time 2D vector illustrations based on Google's [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) and [FaceMesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh) model. It wraps Pose Animator in an Electron app and sends it to a virtual camera for use in video-conferencing apps like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.
